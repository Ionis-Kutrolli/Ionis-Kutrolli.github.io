			<h5>Living in the locals shoes</h5>
			<div class="writing">
				<p>Life at home has always been monotonous to say the very least. I wake up, get ready for school, go to school, come back home, do my homework, and go to bed. With minimal variations day to day, that has been life for ten out of the twelve months in a year. For the two other months, I get a breath of fresh air. Although, the first of these months digs its own repetitive trench. Get up, do something, go to bed. The last month is the real month when I can step off the continuous conveyor belt. Of course, I am talking about the one month my family, sometimes, decides to go on vacation. Usually, it is some very tourist vacation to a tropical location to relax, but a few times in my life I have had the truly unique experience that I like to call living in the local’s shoes.<br>
The most interesting of these experiences was when I spent a month living in Albania. First off, I had spent time in Albania before, but this time I was spending a much longer time there and I was living in my grandmother’s home. Even though, I was living there I never got into a cycle like back at home. Everything was so different from what I knew. The one thing that I noticed right off the bat was how stuck in the past it was there. The cars that you saw with exception to a few were older models. In addition, there was a lot more foot traffic, or at least it seemed like there was a lot more foot traffic to me as I traveled everywhere with my two feet. My favorite of the first impressions was the food. Everything was locally sourced and purchased from what we would call a farmers market, but there it was just the local market. The food almost had another dimension to it that is unexplanatory, so I’m not going to explain it. Let’s just say the food in Albania put the food we eat everyday to shame. <br>
When I said I never got into a monotonous cycle I was partially telling the truth but also partially lying. The first half of the first week I was there I did sort of get into a cycle. Well, not intentionally but since my parents were there I had to meet what felt like the entire city/town I was living in. We either spent the entire day at my grandmother’s house because we were expecting upwards of 5 different families to visit us, or we were visiting upwards of 5 different families. It always started off with a ring of the doorbell and one of us “kids” running down to the gate and opening the door. Then one of my parents would say “Ionis, do you know who this is?”. Well, of course, I had no idea who they were. “Well, this is my second cousin from my mother's side of the family” they would then add when I obviously had no clue who they were. When this interaction between me and my parents was over the visitor would add “WOW, so this is your son he looks just like you” or “The last time I saw you you were just a baby” all in Albanian which I would say I’m not the best at speaking. Without being said this was obviously not my favorite part of the vacation, but it did shed light on what it was like to live in a foreign country like Albania. Of course, I would never get as many visitors as I did those few days, but unlike back a home, people actually went to other people's houses to visit. Back at home the closest we got to people visiting was a friend or two of mine coming over to hang out. When I was there it was a whole big thing. It was like you see in an old movie. Everyone must be well behaved, there was always some sort of snack or drink and the adults always had the same conversations about how life has been. Nonetheless even though it was not the most enjoyable, it was still different from what I experienced during the rest of my life. <br>
The rest of the time spent there was more of an explore and live type of experience. I spent most of the time with my cousins who tried to make the experience interesting even though they had no idea it was already interesting living there. During this time I did something that I had never even imagined of doing. One of the major things I never could have imagined was going without a phone for an entire month. I mean for my monotonous life back at home to be complete my phone could never leave my side. <br>
Since my phone could not entertain me, another thing that I experienced was the nature around the town we were living in. One evening my cousins family and my family went on an excursion through the mountains. These were not like the semi high hills that I experienced in the U.S. These were real mountains part of the alps that run through many countries in Europe. We traveled up and down the windy, almost heart stopping, roads. I like to think that the roads added to the experience. I mean the roads could have caused our deaths at any moment, but they did spark some great conversations. “Hey, lean to this side of the car we need some better traction” one of us would say jokingly. The kids would not sense the joke and quickly lean to one side. It was just some banter to pass the time away, but everything was about the experiences we shared together. Eventually, until we reached a secluded restaurant. It was unlike anything I had ever seen when vacationing in the more tourist ridden countries like, Mexico, Spain, or Greece. It was very simple a few tents set up at the summit of a lower mountain. This simplicity is nothing that a tourist would seek. Even though it looked like a campgrounds high atop a mountain it was one of the most genuinely Albanian moments that I had in Albania. Since the restaurant was simplistic, it was what the locals would seek and since it was not flashy they could focus on what really mattered the food, friends and family. It was amazing and in addition to having delicious food it allowed for us to have a great time spending it talking and having fun rather than taking in an overly expensive gimmick. The experience reminded me of when I was younger. There were not electronics but rather people genuinely talking with each other. The younger kids were running around and playing in the grass while the adults were chatting and laughing at the tables. Somebody would crack a joke every once and awhile and everybody die laughing. These are the moments that are missed when focusing on extravagance. <br>
What stuck with me from that experience with my extended family was the fact that we could have such a great time with what seemed so little. Whenever I have been on vacation elsewhere, as a tourist, what seems like the most fun is the most extravagant of things. But what I realized from living in Albania for a month is that the best experiences come from living as a local. It gives the most genuine experience. All the places I went in Albania were often secluded locations that only those living there would know about. Since they were favored by those that lived there they were the genuinely good places those that were worth experiencing. Locals taught me that even though something is extravagant it does not mean that it is even remotely worth it.</p>

	<h3>College Essay</h3>
	<div class="writing">
		<p>Teaching is something I thought I would never enjoy. I was always the type that liked to amass information to increase the knowledge that I had. However, when I heard of the opportunity to teach elementary school kids the software engineers use every day, I was excited by it. The challenge of teaching a child one of the most complicated software possible is something that intrigued me. The fact that I was teaching something that I did not even understand completely is what drew me in. As I said, teaching something that I had mastered was never something that I enjoyed. Although it is somewhat unconventional, teaching someone a software is the best way to learn it for yourself. When someone asks you to do something new you have to learn how to do it to the point where you can explain it. This new way of learning is what really pulled me into the idea of teaching, or at the very least answer questions.<br>
When teaching something that you have not mastered, there is also an element of learning as well, in any topic. You may get a question that you have never come across and yet is still totally valid. Teaching, to me, is one of the best ways to learn because you learn every way someone can be confused about a topic. Therefore teaching not only helps those who do not understand the topic, but also those that understand it.<br>
Apart from the new experience of teaching, working with young children is also an experience that can teach as well. Young children are very direct and say whatever is on their mind. They also sometimes need more guidance and will also accept more guidance from instructors than adults. When teaching children a new way of thinking develops. To explain something to a child, one must simplify it to the point where they can understand it. When someone reaches the ability to explain the most complicated topics in the most simple terms they truly understand a topic.<br>
At first, teaching the children was one of the most difficult experiences I have ever had. Trying to explain topics that I believed were so trivial were all of a sudden not. Demonstrating how to create a polygon was simple but explaining what I was doing was rocket science. Building a cube seemed trivial, but explaining the concept of adding depth to create a 3-dimensional object was like talking in another language. After teaching a few classes, the explanations became more trivial than the demonstrations. Eventually, I had developed the ability to trivialize even the most complicated topics in the engineering software. I realized that instructing was truly the ultimate learning experience. Although the knowledge that I conveyed was learned the traditional way, mastering the topics came only from teaching.<br>
Coming into contact with the next generation of our society is also an episode that resonated with me. The ability to mold the next generation seems like a powerful tool. The next generation's experiences in their childhood have the ability to make or break the future of the human race. Conveying to children that math and science can be enjoyable can truly push the human race to the next level. Having this effect on children is something that I truly value. Knowing that making a lesson boring has the ability to deter a great mind from pursuing a topic in the future, makes it all the more important to assist in the learning process.<br>
Teaching elementary school children engineering software to me opened my mind about teaching itself. Although it is most likely something that I would not pursue as a profession, it is something that in my mind has a higher value now. Something that I have looked for in a college is having peers around me that value teaching and learning the same ways that I do.</p>

	<h3>Short Story</h3>
	<h5>The Fatal Error</h5>
	<div class="writing">
		<p>Finally, the encryption malware was done and the encryption codes are only stored in the flash drive that I carry around with me everywhere. As soon as I press this button, everything will turn into chaos and I will be the only one that can fix it. I checked to make sure everything was all set once more. This was actually it. I hit enter and the exploit was uploading to the servers. As soon as I wake up, everything will be just great, well, great for me. I fell asleep. It was the best sleep of my life. When I woke up, it was a go, everyone's files and I mean every single person that has ever interacted with this company now had an encrypted file that was useless. The only key for the encryption was the single copy I made to reverse this whole thing. <br> <br>   I poured my l cereal and turned on the news. The anchors were calm as usual and went on with their banter. Nobody knew that during the time they went to bed and woke up all of their information was lost. When I say information I mean debts, salaries, transaction histories, and anything that is required by the U.S government was lost. I was giddy with the thought of everyone's panic for my gain. I would become the most powerful person in every room in the world. <br><br>  It was time for me to go to work and “discover” this hack. I got my best suit and strolled outside and into my car. I was heading straight for work, no detours for coffee or anything like that. This is an important day. For everyone- for the world. For after this day- the world would know me. Me, but not as me. Me, as the masked masquerader, the high lord of the interwebs. I stepped on the gas, spitting rubber as the four-cylinder engine of my Honda Civic screamed with hot air. Today was a day for dashing stunts- I was the dashing man of the ethernets. <br><br>   I arrived at the office and ground the heel of my shoe into the beaten-grey carpet of the office, transferring the weight of my body to the slick plasticine toe of my faux-leather footwear. A subordinate approached, a sheep in my wolf’s den. <br><br>
“Nedry- Nedry- look at this!”. He balanced his laptop on the palm of his hand, his fingers strained to hold the PC. “Someone’s been snooping in our systems. I can’t access any of the information on our servers.”<br><br>   “Have you told anyone else? This might be bad”, I said trying to hide the glee that I felt inside. “I’ll let the higher-ups know, but we need to get this under control.”<br><br>    I walked away as inconspicuous as I could, but right before I reached my office the boss approached me. <br><br>   “So… why are you in such a hurry today?”<br><br>   “Well, it seems we might have a situation on our hands.” I said trembling more than you could believe. “You see, Daren over there”, I pointed towards the person that first discovered my breach, but I could barely hold my hand steady “he was trying to access some information on our servers and he said that we were locked out.”<br><br>   “Locked out? Well, that can’t be. We have the best teams in this hemisphere of the earth.”<br><br>   “I haven’t actually been able to take a look at it yet, I am only conveying the very limited knowledge I have. I’ll take a look and have my team start working on it immediately.” <br><br>   The boss left me alone and I was able to take refuge in my office. I had to make it seem like I was doing work, but I was so jittery. After some time passed, I went to my conference room and called a meeting. This needed to seem real and I needed to seem worried. I could do this. The meeting started and I felt like I was going to pass out. Although this was the case, somehow one thing led to another and it ended with my entire team trying to find out a way to gain control back. I know that they were trying, but I was the one that made it there was no way they were cracking my encryption. <br><br>   As I walked back to my office, I noticed the mood in the room had changed. Everyone was starting to worry about the information that was lost. In no time, the news station had started to pick up on the fact that nobody could access their information. At this point in time, everything was burning to the ground. The boss had called me a total of three times asking me how I let this happen. I had to come up with some very interesting cover stories to not spill my guts. <br><br>   Before starting the restore portion of my plan, I took a deep breath and took in all of the panics. Then I went for my coat pocket where I always kept my USB flash drive. I patted down the pockets and didn’t seem to feel the stiff plastic covering anywhere. I checked the left pocket. Nothing. Then I checked the right pocket, surely it was there. Nothing again. “This is horrible”, I shouted in my soundproofed room. I began to become anxious. I was going to be found out. Without the encryption codes, we would all fall into shambles. If earlier hinted at anything it was that I was unable to control myself when I had a secret. <br><br>   Not being able to calm myself down, I picked up my coat and ran out of the office towards the elevators. I had to retrace my steps. It was always with me, so I must have dropped it somewhere on the way here. On my way onto the elevator, I heard the boss behind me. <br><br>   “Where are you off to? Especially at a time like this.”<br><br>   I did not respond. I just made my way to the lobby. As I was stepping out of the elevator, I saw the building security checking everyone coming in and out of the building. “This is not good” I whispered under my breath. I knew the boss was not going to let anyone from the company out but I didn’t think it was gonna start so soon. I had to make a break for it. As quickly as I could, I slipped through security, even though they tried the best to not let me out and I dashed to my car. For once in my life, traffic was actually non-existent. I made it to my apartment and slammed the door behind me. Before taking anything off, I began to furiously rummage near my work area from last night. No luck. The flash drive was nowhere near my computer. As I was going to walk into my other room, the door rang. <br><br>  “NYPD open up!”<br> <br>  Walking towards the door, I heard another knock this time much louder. I hesitated. Thinking this was the end, either way, I opened the door. People cascaded into my apartment faster than the speed of light. Before I knew it, I was on the ground and my apartment was being searched. Apparently, the boss had called the cops on me as soon as he first saw me in the morning.<br><br>   “Um. Lieutenant, I think we found something”<br><br>   They had wiesel's going through my computer and other people going through every inch of my apartment. The Lieutenant came back to me and in his hand was the USB flash drive with the encryption codes on it.</p>

	<h3>In the Desert Analytical Piece</h3>
	<div class="writing">
		<p>At the very beginning of the poem, Stephen starts off by describing something as “a creature, naked and bestial”. This can be taking in many different ways, but one of the best interpretation that links up to the remaining lines of the poem is that he is actually describing a human. At first glance, it seems a bit ludicrous that he is talking about a human while also describing them as bestial or as a creature, but in the next line he says that it is “squatting upon the ground”. This may seem like a simple description, but there are only a few if any animals that are usually described as squatting. While this might seem weird, more sense is made of it when the creature speaks. When the creature is interacted with, it is said that it holds its own heart. This could mean that it is looking at its true self. This is because one's heart is usually described as being good or bad. When the speaker asks if the heart is good the creature responds with “It is bitter” and since this is its own heart it is really talking about itself. When the creature finally acknowledges that heart is its own heart it also says that it likes “it Because it is bitter And because it is [its] heart” and this finally brings meaning to the full poem. Putting it all together in a more comprehensive interpretation, the creature that is seen in the desert is, in fact, a human who is not perfect but rather imperfect similar to their heart. They seem human because they realize that they are bitter. I think what Stephen crane is trying to say is that humans have this creature inside of them and that they can only get rid of it if they acknowledge and embrace their imperfections.
