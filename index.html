			<h3>Dear Reader,</h3>
			<p>My name is Ionis Kutrolli. I'm 17 and have pretty much lived in Arlington for as long as I can remember. I have only gone to school in Arlington, Massachusetts but I was not born here. Actually, I was born in Michigan and moved to Massachusetts when I was about 4. I barely remember Michigan, but it is part of my past. Next year will be the first time I have moved in 13 years, I am going to RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology) and will most likely be studying computer science. While it has been almost my entire life since I have left Arlington for an extended amount of time, I feel sort of excited. It is going to be something new and out of my comfort zone and after 13 years of comfort I think something new is going to be exhilarating. I am excited by not only the new experiences but also my ability to dive into math, science, and technology I have never gotten my hands on before. But enough about me and my future. This is a portfolio of the work that I have completed in the Memoir, Poetry and Fiction class at Arlington High school. As you may come to notice a lot of it is about science and technology. I understand that those two things are not everyone's forte but they are my interest. Honestly, when it comes to writing it is very hard for me to write without including math, science or technology. While I love those subject, I do in a way dislike that I do not try to move away from them more. Although this is the case I have tried to include a few pieces that are not heavily reliant on science or technology. To end things off, MPF has been one of the most interesting English classes that I have taken. It takes a different twist on the conventional English classes I have taken in the past and honestly, I like it so much more. We were able to have more freedom in writing and the reading, unlike other classes, was not half bad.<br><br>-Ionis Kutrolli</p>
