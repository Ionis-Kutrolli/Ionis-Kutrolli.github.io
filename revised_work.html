			<h3>Poem #1</h3>
			<h5>Potential</h5>
			<p>It started with no stress,<br><br>And no pressure<br><br>But by result there was no potential<br><br>As time went on<br><br>Weight added a ton<br><br>And it was ready to go celestial<br><br>When the weight goes away<br><br>The spring will shoot straight up</p>
			<div class="explanation" id="explanation">
			<p>The reason I chose this poem is because I liked the metaphor that I put in place. I liked the idea of my current position being a compressed spring and eventually I will be let free.</p>

			<h3>Poem #2</h3>
			<h5>Net Neutrality</h5>
			<p>The internet was meant to be decentralized<br>to a point<br>Nobody should be limited<br>There was no reason for change<br>The petitioner is a thorn<br>Putting cuffs on typing hands<br><br>Nothing needed to change, yet a thorn<br>in everyone's side decided it would be a good idea<br>One little vote and many fake petitions<br>got the ball rolling<br>a ball that no one could stop<br>because the thorn kept pushing<br><br>all the real grievances were drowned<br>since there are more fake people<br>then there are real<br></p>

			<p>I chose this poem because it was about something that I cared about. I felt that since I cared about it then it would make a good addition to the porfolio.</p>

			<h3>Poem #3</h3>
			<h5>Moving Memories</h5>
			<p>Goodbye old world,<br>Old friends,<br>Now you are distant memories,<br>There is only this green car<br>And endless road ahead<br><br>Midway through,<br>We take a pitstop.<br>There are walls of water crashing down<br>And mist that dampens the air<br><br>Eventually we leave this world,<br>As well.<br>The final destination,<br>That’s all there’s left.<br>With an old green car,<br>And a few souvenirs,<br>We enter the new world<br>That I seem to have always known.</p>
		<div class="explanation">
			<p>While this poem seems darker than it really is, it is just one of my earliest memories. I chose this because it is a reminder of some of my earliest memories, moving to Massachusetts.</p>

			<h3>WNB #1</h3>
			<div class="wnb">
			<p>I wish I was 6 again so I could not have a care in the world. So every day was the best day. When I was 6 all I thought about was how to have fun. Nowadays most of the time stress takes over. Grades need to be good and fun is the last thing on my mind. The entire world to a six-year-old doesn't contain stress the only things that exist are enjoyment and boredom. The entirety of my world when I was six revolved around turning boredom into enjoyment. When there was nothing to do boredom slowly crept up to take over the world. That is when a portal of imagination opened up. I would walk through thee. portal and boredom would vanish. Creativity would take over. One time I would be fighting the sith from Star Wars and other times pirates. When the portal opened to the other dimension boredom disappeared and creativity materialized in many shapes and forms.</p>

			<h3>WNB #2</h3>
			<div class="wnb">
			<p>How do kids these days even get enjoyment? All day long hey are inside of their metal electronic boxes. They no longer go out and have social interactions in person. Back when I was a kid there was not text. When you wanted to "hang out" with someone you had to go outside to ask them. Today's kids have just become lazy. They have technology that does everything we had to so on our own. Kids have gotten lazy even in school. Using the google to answer all their questions and not even being able to do math in their heads. In addition, because of the laziness they have developed. Kids nowadays are so impatient. They want everything done for them and immediately to make it even worse. When I was young waiting and being patient was the norm. If you were waiting to get forms to dill out for a job or something you had to wait. Now kids can just download and print at home and send them immediately. Everything is at their fingertips. They don't have to work for anything.</p>

			<h3>WNB #3</h3>
			<div class="wnb">
			<p>Well, today is the day. The entire family was gathered to hear Aunt Edna's will. I hope I will get at least something that would alleviate the money struggles that I have sort of been dealing with. At this point in time, I had no idea what was in store for me. Everyone was called into what sort of looked like a boardroom but not really. The lawyer sat at the front welcoming us. He then asked us to quiet down and he began. "Before we begin", he said, "This is the finalized will of Edna Smith. Everything written in this will is final and cannot be changed." He then continued with all of the legal mumbo-jumbo. Then he paused. He looked somewhat confused. As if he had not seen this before. He looked up and promptly asked. "Before I go any further who is the youngest person present above or at the age of 18?" Everyone immediately looked at me. I then raised my hand and he asked for my name. I responded hesitantly, "Adam is my name sir". He then asked me to stand up and make my way up to him. Once I made it up to him he asked me to wait for him to finish reading the will. He picked back up saying "I Edna Smith hereby leave all my worldly possessions that being: property, savings, investments and all items of value once owned by me to..." he paused once again and looked at me. He then continued "to Adam Smith" he finally finished. He closed the folder and explained to everyone it asked for the youngest person at or above the age of 18. I was shocked. I had just become magnitudes richer. The lawyer saw me in shock and sat down once again. He opened his folder and began reading again, "The inheritance to the person named can and will only proceed if said person reveals at this time their deepest darkest secret to everyone present in the room. If this condition is not met all possessions in question are to be donated to charity or sold and have the profits donated to charity." He stopped and my heart almost sank. I was gonna throw up. I was so close to being rich yet so dar. I couldn't possibly think about sharing this secret, not in front of my parents and the rest of the family. I had only ever told aunt Edna. But this couldn't have been done to make me share my secret could it? I was being torn up from the inside out. I couldn't let all this wealth slip from my hands. I had made my decision I was gonna come clean. I opened my mouth "..." nothing came out. I tried again "Ah... umm... My..." I just couldn't do it. Once again I tried, "My-My biggest sec-secret that I've never told anyone... is..."....".</p>
