				<p>    I chose the ten writers notebook that I did as my ten favorite entries because they were the ones that I had the most fun writing. They are the ones that I feel I was able to convey my distinctive voice in the most effective. For example, the entry that I chose about stories per square inch. I chose that entry specifically because I had fun writing it as if I was telling a story out loud. I chose to write it in a unique way and I tried to capture the way that I speak in it. Similarly all the other entries I included I either found a unique way to write them or I just truly enjoyed the topic I was writing about. This notebook throughout this year has been an interesting experience, to say the least. It has allowed me to write in the ways that I feel comfortable with but also it has pushed me to write in ways that I would have never really written in. It has made me write stories about stuff I would have never even thought about like the story I wrote about the will. At the very least I do not believe I would have ever written a story like that without this writer’s notebook. Since I have had such a great experience with this writer’s notebook, I honestly don’t think I would change anything about it at all. It pushes people to think and write about new things. Once again, the most challenging thing that I have faced with the writer’s notebook process is being pushed to write about things that I would have never even thought about. To be honest, even though it made me think, I still enjoyed it. The most successful prompt that I wrote I think were the stories per square inch and the will story. The reason for this is I feel as if I took those two topics and really ran with them. They were some of my longest entries because I had some much I could write with them. In general, it was the prompts that pushed me to think before writing that was the most successful because when I would think I would formulate better entries. I cannot say for sure if I will keep the notebook. Not because I do not want to, but because I do not know if I can go without losing it. </p>

				<p>This is the end of High School English. A portfolio of some of what I believe were the best works for an entire year of learning. The pieces that I included both short entries and longer pieces were hopefully a good variety of creative writing, pieces that interested me and also pieces that pushed me away from what I am comfortable with. All in all the work that I included was what I believed the best applications of what we learned to do this year. Mostly the use of “show don’t tell” and making sure everything in the writing has a purpose. Some of my favorite examples of showing instead of telling was using dialogue and the best dialogue, I think, came from WNB #3. Dialogue is a great way to show what a person or people are feeling and I think that the story about Aunt Edna’s will was one of my best applications. What else I think I had a great application of was adding my own voice in some pieces. In pieces that had a narrator, the specific voice and attitude of the narrator made them some of the better examples of good writing. The writing included in this portfolio is some of the unique writing I have done in all of the high school as well. Most of the writing that was done this year was much more creative. In the past years, it has always been very structured and analytical. This year was much different. The writing could anything there were no set boundaries or limitations that sculpted our writing. The only thing that sculpted our writing was us. It was fun going back through everything that we had done this year and seeing what my mind came up. It was also very difficult picking out the few pieces that I did since there were so many and they were all different as well.<br><br>-Ionis Kutrolli</p>
